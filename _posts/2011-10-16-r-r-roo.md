subtitle: Developer Transcript - re-implementing using Spring Roo

Knowing exactly what the model should be, re-creating it with Roo is incredibly
easy. Erecting scaffolding is fast and gratifying. All positive, until.. it does
support what should be simple things. Makes it feel incomplete. 
(Re-)Develop
------------

* Working with CRUD
  * of course: always explicitly mention the type attribute on RelatedTo to
    get symmetric recognition
* Ah, I'd forgotten what a productive joy it is to blindly splash into the mysterious waters of Spring
  * Spring's fault? Just jspx? ...
  *  `<script type="text/javascript" src="${jquery_min_url}"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></script>`
  * Without that intervening comment, the script element swallow everything else in the document.
  * ah, it looks like in general elements with empty content are not processed properly.
