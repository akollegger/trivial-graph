title: STS Fails
subtitle: Developer Transcript - re-implementing using Spring Roo
---

Knowing exactly what the model should be, re-creating it with Roo is incredibly
easy. Erecting scaffolding is fast and gratifying. All positive, until.. it does
support what should be simple things. Makes it feel incomplete. 

STS Productivity Killer
-----------------------

* Crashes all the time. I'm thrilled if I can get an hour of coding without a crash.
* Stupid Spring Dashboard re-presents itself every boot. Maybe once per day would be
  ok, if the IDE didn't require force-quits and restarts on a regular basis. The view
  improperly directs my ire at SpringSource. 
* restart, restart, clean the workspace (rm -rf all eclipse files), re-import my project

* short people on planes always feel the need to lean their seats all the way back
